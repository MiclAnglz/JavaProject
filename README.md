# Java Project 
<h4>(My First Major Coding Project)</h4>
Programming Techniques Major Project - Java

Spring Semester
Programming Techniques 

<strong>Task: </strong>Create a system application for a ficticious air conditioning business.
The project requirements were to design an object
orientated Java program to
assist the business in keeping records of repair, service and
installation.

Upon execution, the program had to read data into arrays from 3 main files - a
customer file, a booking file and a service file. The program also had to handle
files with null values and different data types (int, float, doubles).

The program then had to give the user the ability to interact with the data in
the arrays and display the items in a meaningful way i.e.

• Allow the user to display customer booking

• Allow the user to change customer bookings and set fees

• Allow the user to display the customers service history, price of the service,
date, customer id and name

• Allow the user to apply discounts based on the customer's request. The
program was to accept a value from the customer and if that value was
greater than 10% of the service cost; the total amount of the service was to
remain If the value was 10% or less then the program was to accept and
update the value in the program and write the update into the booking text
file

• Allow the user to display full details of a service (service id , price and
description)

• Allow the user to search customer information by surname and phone
number. Many customers on the customer text file also had the same name.
The program had to be designed to present all customers with the same
name on the file and display the information that would differentiate one
from the other

• Allow the user to save or cancel changes made to text file
Note: The meta data were on separate files (e.g. customer id, name from the
customer file, part number from the service, the price, and description). This
was quite challenging as there were numerous ways to program the
requirements.
